# Customer Churn Prediction for a Bank
## Introduction
<br />According to the Cambridge dictionary, churn is defined as “the number of customers who decide to stop using a service offered by one company and to use another company, usually because it offers a better service or price”. It is cheaper to retain existing customers than to acquire new ones, therefore understanding the reason customers churn is very important for a bank and any other business in general. 

<br />This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a bank 
The main goal of this project is to develop a model that can predict whether a bank's customers are likely to churn based on the features. This will allow the bank to take proactive measures to retain customers at risk of churning, thereby improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.
